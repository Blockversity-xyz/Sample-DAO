# BlockVersity-DAO

[BlockVersity](https://www.blockversity.xyz/) is THE marketplace for online courses supported by a DAO. BlockVersity's objective is to become the largest decentralized NFT marketplace for continuous education, giving power back to Course Creators and verifiable on-chain credentials to students.

BlockVersity gives power back to thousands of global course creators selling on centralized marketplaces, offering them fairer compensation by providing an NFT marketplace to sell courses. For students, BlockVersity provides them with verifiable on-chain credentials. These proof-of-skill NFTs would have the same credibility globally.

## Overview

 Congratulations! This is the first step in your journey towards learning how to build a DAO on the Flow network. This document's objective is to provide the basic tools and help you understand how to use them. 
 
 All of the code that interacts with Flow is written with Cadence; a a new high-level programming language intended for smart contract development.

 The tools used for testing the smart contracts, scripts and transactions are written in Go and are part of the [Overflow](https://github.com/bjartek/overflow) library.
