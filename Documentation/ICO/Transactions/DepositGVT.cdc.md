This Cadence transaction is used to transfer tokens from one account's vault to another account's vault. It involves the following steps:

1. **Importing the necessary contracts**: The transaction imports the `GovTokenPublicSale`, `GToken`, and `FungibleToken` contracts from the Flow blockchain. These contracts are used to interact with the tokens and the sale process.

2. **Defining the transaction**: The transaction is defined with a single parameter, `amount`, which specifies the number of tokens to be transferred.

3. **Preparing the transaction**: The `prepare` function is used to set up the transaction. It does the following:

- It gets the account at the address `0xba85020e56e96b74`, which is presumably the provider's account.
    
- It borrows a reference to the provider's vault from the account's capabilities. If the reference cannot be borrowed, the transaction panics with the message "Could not borrow reference to the provider's Vault".
    
- It borrows references to the `Admin` resource and the `Vault` resource from the account's storage. If the references cannot be borrowed, the transaction panics with the appropriate messages.
    
- It withdraws the specified `amount` of tokens from the provider's vault and stores them in the `sentVault` variable.
    

4. **Executing the transaction**: The `execute` function is used to perform the transaction. It deposits the tokens from the `sentVault` into the `Admin` resource.

Here's the documentation for each part of the transaction:

## Importing the contracts

```cadence
import GovTokenPublicSale from 0xba85020e56e96b74
import GToken from 0xba85020e56e96b74
import FungibleToken from 0xc61f695fe4f80614
```

These lines import the necessary contracts from the Flow blockchain.

## Defining the transaction

```cadence
transaction(amount: UFix64) {
   let adminRef: &GovTokenPublicSale.Admin
   let sentVault: @FungibleToken.Vault

```



This line defines the transaction, which takes one parameter, `amount`, and declares two variables, `adminRef` and `sentVault`.

## Preparing the transaction

```cadence
prepare(account: AuthAccount) {
   let provider = getAccount(0xba85020e56e96b74)
   let providerVaultRef = provider
       .getCapability(GToken.VaultPublicPath)
       .borrow<&GToken.Vault{FungibleToken.Provider}>()
       ?? panic("Could not borrow reference to the provider's Vault")

```

This block of code prepares the transaction by getting the provider's account and borrowing a reference to the provider's vault.

## Executing the transaction

```cadence
execute {
   self.adminRef.depositGVT(from: <-self.sentVault)
}
```

This block of code executes the transaction by depositing the tokens from the `sentVault` into the `Admin` resource
